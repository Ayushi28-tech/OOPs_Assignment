    " Protects the internal state of objects and prevents unintended interference or misuse.\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Abstraction for Simplification:\n",
    " Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential functionalities.\n",
    " \n",
    " Helps in managing complexity and focusing on high-level design.\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Polymorphism for Flexibility:\n",
    " Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",

    " --> Class variables and instance variables are two types of variables used to store data within a class. Their scope and usage differ significantly:\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Class Variable:\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Definition:\n",
    " A variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It belongs to the class itself rather than any particular object.\n",
    "   \n",
    " #### Storage:\n",
    " Stored in the class namespace.\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Access:\n",
    " Can be accessed using the class name or through an instance, but any change made through the class affects all instances.\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Use Case:\n",
    " Commonly used for constants or data shared by all instances.\n",

    " #### Example: \n",

    "  ### Instance Variable:\n",
    "  \n",
